== SYNOPSIS

Similarity Engine allows you to easily compute sets of similar objects (AR). 
It will evolve into a rails plugin that gives you a full recommendation 
engine with minimal code changes. 

== THIS VERSION

This version is a minimal start into the direction I want to go. As of now, 
there is no real documentation (except in the code) and no official release. 
Ask me for usage instructions at eule at space dot ch.
